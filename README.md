### Introduction
Testing is an integral part of enterprise software development. The purpose of this project is to create a gamified platform for education of software development - more specifically to enhance users' understanding of how TDD (Test-Driven-Development) works and is best practised. The name 'TDD-PingPong' references to the alternating nature of the gameplay mechanism: two players implement code against one another, taking turns between testing and implementing given programming task. TDD-PingPong aims to make the learning experience of TDD core principles more dynamic which further motivates students to learn software development.

### Development
TDD-PingPong is developed in Java 8 using Spring-boot's Web MVC framework. Dependency management is handled by Gradle. Project is structured following MVC (Model-View-Controller) design structure.
